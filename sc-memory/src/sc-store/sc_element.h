/* Structure to store information for sc-elements.
 * It used just for unify working with node and arc elements.
 * When you get that structure, you need to check it type and
 * cast to sc_node or sc_arc structure depending on type.
 *
 * Each element identifier contains two numbers:
 * segment identifier and element identifier. Element
 * identifier is unique for specified segment.
 * Node also contains information about const and struct types.
 * It store as a one char for each of types.
 * Each node have a pointer to content assigned with it. If pointer is null,
 * then node haven't any content data.
 * Last part of node information is a pointers to the lists of input and output arcs.
 * Each list of arcs contains pointer to array of arcs pointers.
 * Size of each array is fixed and equivalent to ARC_SEG_SIZE value.
 *
 * All arcs have next_arc and prev_arc addr's. Each element store addr of begin and end arcs.
 * Arcs values: next_out_arc and next_in_arc store next arcs in output and input arcs list.
 * So if you need to iterate all output arcs for specified element, then you need to use such code:
 * sc_element *arc = sc_storage_get_element(el->first_output_arc);
 * while (!addr_empty(arc->incident->next_out_arc))
 * {
 *     <you code>
 *     arc = sc_storage_get_element(arc->incident->next_out_arc);
 * }
